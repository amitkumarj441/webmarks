## WorldBrain web client. Fast. Simple. 

[WorldBrain](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks) is a project for annotaing 
web and helping others to find the Truth online. In this repo we are building client 
for WorldBrain [Search](https://github.com/WorldBrain/search-engine).

First version of the client is based in the [React Starter](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux) project. 
Use use it as starting point for client development and later will come up with our own way of building front-end app.
