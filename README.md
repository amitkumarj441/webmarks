## WorldBrain's Webmarks web client

Webmarks is a tool for science communicators (scientists, journalist, skeptics) to find quality scientific web content faster. 

**The key features are:**
 - A search engine in the form of browser-sidebar, that lets users perform keyword searches through a list of outlets flagged by the user and/or our scientific community as trustworthy. (blogs, news, FB groups/pages, scholarly/governmental DBs)
 - A recommendation engine to get related content to the immediate article, also only from these trusted sources, displayed in the sidebar.


### Next Milestone:

We are currently working towards the first prototype: Our search engine.

In its first version it is a simple google-like landingpage, a results page and a page where we list all the already indexed outlets. 
Mockups you find [here](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/issues/9#issuecomment-231402452).

You want to contribute to our front-end development? Introduce yourself in _Team Client_'s [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/WorldBrain/TEAM_WorldBrain_client)

### Technical Implementation:

First version of the client is based in the [React Starter](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux) project. 
Use use it as starting point for client development and later will come up with our own way of building front-end app.
